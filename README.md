# Bay Forecast

A program that allows the user to check the forecast of popular cities in the bay area. The data is from the [Weather Forecast API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs) and the [Geocoding API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/geocoding-api).
This code uses miltiprocessing and multithreading to understand the difference in speed between the two programs. Run either file, it is the same code fairly, and see the difference bettwen multithreading vs multiprocessing. After the user selects as many cities they want to see, the user will be prompted to saving their search results in a file when they try to close the app. This process uses the OS system module to ask the user where they would like their file saved.
